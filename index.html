					The Brain is one of the most complex things that you have control over, however you first need to learn to access it's full potential if you want to be efficient and effective in the areas you focus on!
					<br>

					There's many things you might not think about that we'll go over here, such as:
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Why you may often forget things</li>
						<li>Why it might be as they say "right on the tip of my tongue" but you can't exactly recall it.</li>
						<li>How the Way you study effects how well you perform.</li>
						<li>Over Learning</li>
						<li>Proper proven study strategies</li>
					</ul>

					Our Brain could very easily be compared to that of an SD Card or a Flash Drive. When you transfer data to a Flash Drive the computer must first encode, copy, and "memorize" the data to the flash drive. It goes through several phases, and anything could go wrong in the process causing it to store only a partial amount or none of the data at all.
					<br>
					This is very similar to how out brains work. When processing new information, the information will pass through several parts of the brain before it is fully retained. Many parts such as the Hippocampus <span style="color: blue">(The area that helps with recognition of memory and processing information for long and short term memory)</span>, the Prefrontal Cortex <span style="color: blue">(Which is where short-term memories are stored)</span>, to even the Neocortex <span style="color: blue">(Responsible for general knowledge)</span>.

					Have you ever gone through a class, or a meeting perhaps, and left thinking that you're well versed in the topic, but only to find out the next day that you cant even remember what it was that you went through or talked about? This is a common issue that every human being has encountered at one point in their lives. There are multiple things that could lead to forgetting, such as:
					<ul>
						<li>Interference</li>
						<li>Mental Overcrowding</li>
						<li>Not Enough Processing Time</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					Let's Start with the most common example here. Lets be honest, Most of the time, you walk out of a classroom or meeting and get right on your phone, checking texts or taking phone calls. A lot of us are guilty of this, we don't allow our brain enough time to process all the information you may have just learned, and instead are just overwhelming our brain with more information. Your brain needs a sufficient amount of time to sort through and attempt to store and solidify the information you just took in, so adding in more interference will also crowd your brain, causing it to dispose of the older information to make room for new information.
					<br><br>
					Another common issue we run into is Mental Overcrowding. While we might try to, and say that we can, a human brain cannot process multiple forms of information at once. Multitasking is just not probable and should be avoided as much as possible especially when learning. What you're brain ends up doing is "goal shifting" (Kendra Cherry), which just switches your attention from one to another.
					<br><br>
					Interference is also another issue that we have to work with. It is essentially that new information you learn would interfere with previously learned information. A simple way to prevent this is to consistently review material, old and new to strengthen their connections. (Angela Zanardelli)

					You're guilty of it, i'm guilty of it. Everyone at one point has done it, cramming...<br>It's the terrible sin that we've all committed at one point, and we should make a habit of breaking up with it and staying away. To keep it blunt, cramming does not work, period. It's been proven, it's been tested, and it does more harm than good actually. Most of the time you just teach yourself what's written on the paper instead of actually connecting to it and learning it on a deeper level. It increases your stress levels and make it even harder for you to try to concentrate. There are however many very effective and proven study strategies that work, and they work wonders if you're willing to give them a try!

				<p style="width: 96%; overflow-wrap: break-word;">
					Now lets get to the stuff that'll make you and your brain very happy! (See the brain on the left, it's very happy because it listened to my tips :P). The two that i would highly suggest and have worked great for me are:
					<ul>
						<li>Testing Your Comprehension</li>
						<li>Short, Frequent Reviews</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

					The first technique you have at your disposal is testing your comprehension. You can do this in various ways like summarizing in your own words, attempting to teach the content to others, or coming up with your own unique examples. This is very helpful because it not only tests what you know, but lets you know what you need to also work on, just like a quote of Richard Bach, "Doing is demonstrating that you know it."
					<br><br>
					Another technique is Short but Frequent Reviews, and this one can especially be helpful. By spacing out your reviews and practice you allow your brain time to process and comprehend all the information you just took in, without overwhelming it. When you get back to the review your brain will be recharged and ready to take on some more information. You could also use dual coding with this, which can be very helpful to some people. Dual Coding is essentially combining you're notes or information with visuals. It allows you to match various items up with images that help when trying to recall them in the future. Your more likely to remember something from seeing a picture example which is why its so effective.

					Hey you've made it to the end! Thanks for reading and I hope you at least got something out of this. It was a really fun project for me to do since it was my first time using illustrator and making digital vector illustrations instead of normal drawings! If you have any issues reading the book or loading it please send me an email so i could take a look at it and fix it asap! (techperson71@gmail.com). Thanks!
